# ⚡️[Automation] ToolsQA | Elements | Dynamic Properties

[GX3-5590](https://upexgalaxy47.atlassian.net/browse/GX3-5590) Created: 10/31/24

**As**  QA learner
**I want to test** Dynamic Properties
    *- Element has Dynamic ID in DOM*
    *- Element is enable after 5 sec*
    *- Element is visible after 5 sec*
    *- Element CSS color is changed*
**In order to** be able to improve my testing skills for this scenario

```feature
Feature: ToolsQA | Elements | Dynamic Properties

✅ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

    “This text has random Id“
        For Element: Dynamic ID, QA should validate getting the element without using “text“ (contains text)
        ID is generic and with every reload the id is changed, so:
            How to get an element if the ID is dynamic, and it doesn’t have class, names, or any other attribute?

    “Will enable 5 seconds“
        The element should be asserted before and after is enabled.

    “Color Change“
        The element should be asserted before and after the color is changed.
        PD: there’s no any CSS color property assigned to the element, but class name instead.

    “Visible After 5 Seconds“
        the element should be asserted before and after is visible.
